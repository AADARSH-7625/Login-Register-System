<h1>Login & Register System Website</h1>

This is a demo project showcasing a Login & Registration System built using PHP and MySQL. It includes user registration and login functionalities with basic validation and stores user data in a MySQL database.

<h2>Features</h2>

**User Registration:** New users can sign up with their email, first name, last name, and password.<br>
**User Login:** Authenticated users can securely log in with their email and password.<br>
**Password Validation:** Ensures that the password and confirm password match during the registration process.<br>
**Database Integration:** User information is stored and retrieved from a MySQL database.<br>
**Error Handling:** Prevents duplicate email registrations and ensures proper form validation.<br>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
**Backend:** PHP<br>
**Database:** MySQL (for storing user information)<br>

<h2>Project Overview</h2> 

This project demonstrates a simple and effective login and registration system, with the following functionalities:<br>

**Registration Form:** Users can create an account by providing their email, first name, last name, and password. The form checks for errors like password mismatch or an existing email.<br>

**Login Form:** Registered users can log in by entering their email and password. If the credentials are valid, the user is redirected to a home page or dashboard.<br>

**User Authentication:** The system verifies user credentials during login and ensures that only valid users can access protected pages.<br>

**Security:** Passwords are hashed before being stored in the database to enhance security.<br>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

**Registration:** The user enters their details, and the form checks for errors like password mismatch or an already registered email. The data is then inserted into the MySQL database.<br>

**Login:** The user enters their email and password, and the system verifies the credentials. If valid, the user is logged in.<br>
**Database:** User details are securely stored in a MySQL database, and passwords are hashed for additional security.<br>
**Session Management:** Once logged in, users are given access to certain protected pages, and their session remains active until they log out.<br>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

- Add password reset functionality for forgotten passwords.<br>
- Implement email verification for user registrations.<br>
- Enhance the UI/UX for a more modern and responsive design.<br>
- Add features like user profile management and session expiration for better security.<br>
